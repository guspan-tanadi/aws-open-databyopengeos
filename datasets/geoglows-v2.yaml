Name: GEOGLOWS Hydrologic Model Version 2
Description: |
  The GEOGLOWS Hydrologic Model provides a global simulation of river discharge. The model simulates river discharge at 
  7 million river segments over a period of more than 80 years beginning on 1 January 1940. The retrospective simulation 
  is updated weekly to monthly keeping the lag time small. The model is also used to produce daily forecasts which are 
  not archived in this repository. The model is based on the ERA5 reanalysis climate data and forecasts are derived from 
  the ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS). The stream network is derived from the TDX-Hydro streams and basins data 
  produced by the United State's National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. The model simulations are computed daily at 
  the ECMWF super computing facility in Bologna, Italy.<br><br>
  The geoglows-v2 bucket contains: (1) model configuration files used to generate the simulations, (2) the GIS streams 
  datasets used by the model, (3) the GIS streams datasets optimized for visualizations used by Esri's Living Atlas 
  layer, (4) several supporting table of metadata including country names, river names, hydrologic properties used for
  modeling.<br><br>
  The geoglows-v2-retrospective bucket contains: (1) the model retrospective outputs in (1a) zarr format optimized for 
  time series queries of up to a few hundred rivers on demand as well as (1b) in netCDF format best for bulk downloading 
  the dataset, (2) estimated return period flows for all 7 million million rivers (2a) in zarr format optimized for 
  reading subsets of the dataset as well as (2b) in netCDF format best for bulk downloading. (3) The initialization files 
  produced at the end of each incremental simulation useful for restarting the model from a specific date.<br><br>
