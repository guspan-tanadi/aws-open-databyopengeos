Name: DARPA Invisible Headlights Dataset
Description: |
  "The DARPA Invisible Headlights Dataset is a large-scale multi-sensor dataset annotated for autonomous, off-road navigation in challenging off-road environments. It features simultaneously collected off-road imagery from multispectral, hyperspectral, polarimetric, and broadband sensors spanning wave-lengths from the visible spectrum to long-wave infrared and provides aligned LIDAR data for ground-truth shape. Camera calibrations, LiDAR registrations, and traversability annotations for a subset of the data are available."
